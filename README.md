# Abstract
Reducing hospital readmissions is a critical concern for healthcare systems aiming to improve patient outcomes and lower costs. This study leverages machine learning to predict hospital readmission risk and uncover patient wellness profiles through clustering. Using the UCI Diabetes Hospital Readmission dataset, which includes over 100,000 hospital visits, we examine various clinical and administrative variables such as number of prior inpatient visits, medication changes, and primary diagnoses. The project applies supervised classification techniques—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Random Forests, and Neural Networks—to predict readmission. Unsupervised clustering using KMeans and Agglomerative Clustering, coupled with PCA visualization, is also used to explore patient segmentation. The aim is twofold: to develop accurate predictive models and to identify actionable subgroups of patients for care optimization. This interim report presents preprocessing, model development, and initial evaluation metrics to establish a baseline for further refinement.
